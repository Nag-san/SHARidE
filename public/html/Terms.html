My apologies for the oversight. Here's the corrected paragraph with all the requested changes:

"FOR THE PURPOSES OF SHARidE BIKEPOOLING SERVICES, SHARidE BIKEPOOLING Platform DOES NOT PROVIDE PUBLIC OR PRIVATE TRANSPORTATION SERVICES, AND SHARidE BIKEPOOLING SERVICE IS NOT A TRANSPORTATION CARRIER. IT IS UP TO THE “SHARER” OR RIDE VEHICLE OWNER TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO OFFER A RIDE TO A “SHAREE” CONTACTED THROUGH THE SHARidE BIKEPOOLING PLATFORM, AND IT IS UP THE “SHAREE” TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO ACCEPT A RIDE FROM ANY “SHARER” CONTACTED THROUGH THE SHARidE BIKEPOOLING PLATFORM. ANY DECISION BY A USER (SHARER OR SHAREE) TO OFFER OR TAKE RIDE ONCE SUCH USER IS MATCHED THROUGH THE SHARidE BIKEPOOLING PLATFORM IS A DECISION MADE IN SUCH USER’S SOLE DISCRETION. SHARidE BIKEPOOLING SERVICE OFFERS INFORMATION AND A METHOD TO DISCOVER AND CONNECT “SHARERS” AND “SHAREES” WITH EACH OTHER, BUT DOES NOT INTEND TO AND DOES NOT PROVIDE TRANSPORTATION SERVICES OR ACT IN ANY MANNER AS A TRANSPORTATION CARRIER, AND HAS NO RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY FOR ANY TRANSPORTATION SERVICES VOLUNTARILY PROVIDED TO ANY “SHAREE” BY ANY “SHARER” USING THE SHARidE BIKEPOOLING PLATFORM. YOU AGREE THAT SHARidE BIKEPOOLING PLATFORM ONLY PLAYS A TRANSIENT ROLE IN PROVIDING A TECHNOLOGICAL PLATFORM FOR CONNECTING YOU WITH A SHARER/SHAREE, AS THE CASE MAY BE, AND AS SUCH, SHARidE BIKEPOOLING PLATFORM IS AND CONTINUES TO BE AN INTERMEDIARY FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ACT, 2000."
